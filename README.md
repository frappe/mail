## Functionality

This section explains the core functionalities of Frappe Mail, including how to manage domains, accounts, groups, and aliases, as well as how to send and receive emails. It also covers the management of email queues for efficient processing.

### Managing Domains, Accounts, Groups, and Aliases

Frappe Mail provides an easy-to-use interface for managing the various components of your email system. Here's how you can set up and manage each of these elements:

#### Domains:

- A domain represents your email domain (e.g., example.com) and is used to define the sending and receiving email addresses.
- You can add, remove, and configure multiple domains in Frappe Mail. Each domain must be verified and associated with the appropriate MX, SPF, and DKIM records to ensure email deliverability and security.

#### Accounts:

- An mail account in Frappe Mail is associated with a user (with Mail User role) (e.g., user@example.com).
- You can create accounts manually through the desk, and assign roles and permissions to manage who can send and receive emails.

#### Groups:

- Mail groups allow you to organize multiple email accounts under one entity. These are useful for managing shared email addresses or sending emails to a group of recipients.
- You can create and manage groups within the app and assign members to each group.
- A group can also have a group as a member, allowing for nested group structures.

#### Aliases:

- Aliases are alternative email addresses for existing accounts or group (e.g., sale@example.com could be an alias for sales@example.com).
- Aliases can be managed and configured to forward incoming emails to the main account or to a group.

### Sending and Receiving Emails

Frappe Mail simplifies the process of sending and receiving emails through its seamless integration with the Mail Agent (Stalwart Mail Server). Here's how it works:

#### Sending Emails:

- To send an email, Frappe Mail connects to the SMTP server through the configured Mail Agent.
- When a user sends an email, Frappe Mail retrieves an available connection from the SMTP pool. If no connection is available, a new one is created.
- The email is then processed, and if necessary, additional operations such as DKIM signing are performed before sending the email through the Mail Agent to the recipient's mail server.

#### Receiving Emails:

- Frappe Mail also manages the IMAP connection for receiving emails. It connects to the configured IMAP server and periodically checks for new emails.
- Once an email is received, it is stored in the user's inbox/spam folder based on the email's classification.
- Users can access their received emails through the app’s inbox interface, and emails can be organized into folders or marked with labels as needed.

### Queue Management

Frappe Mail uses a queueing system to manage the sending and receiving of emails efficiently. This ensures that email traffic is processed in a timely manner without overloading the system.

#### Email Queue for Outbound Emails:

- Emails are placed in a queue before being sent out. This allows the system to manage high volumes of outgoing emails by ensuring that they are sent in a order.
- The queue can be monitored and managed, and administrators can control the maximum number of concurrent connections to the mail server for optimized performance.

#### Inbound Email Queue:

Similarly, inbound emails are placed in a queue for processing. This allows Frappe Mail to handle large volumes of incoming emails and ensures that each email is processed properly, including filtering, categorization, and delivery to the appropriate inbox.

#### Error Handling:

- If there’s an error while sending or receiving an email, it is placed in a separate error queue. Administrators can review these emails and resolve any issues that might have caused the failure (e.g., connection issues, invalid credentials, etc.).

Queue management ensures that emails are processed efficiently, even under high load, and provides the necessary tools for administrators to keep track of all email activity.
