## Step 5: Set Up Inbound Mail Agents

Inbound Mail Agents handle the receiving of emails. Their setup is similar to outbound agents, but you donâ€™t need to worry about checking the IP blacklist status for inbound agents since they aren't responsible for sending emails.

### 5.1 Add a DNS A Record

Create a DNS record for your inbound Mail Agent using the following naming convention:

```plaintext
<agent-type><agent-number>-<region-short-name>.<root-domain>
```

For example, for the first inbound Mail Agent in Bangalore:

```plaintext
i1-blr.frappemail.com
```

**Steps to Add the DNS Record:**

1. **Login to your DNS provider's dashboard** (such as Cloudflare, GoDaddy, etc.).
2. **Add an A Record:**

   - **Name:** `i1-blr` (or your chosen name based on the convention)
   - **Type:** A
   - **TTL:** Auto or a specific TTL value
   - **Value:** IP address of your inbound Mail Agent VPS

   This will make the inbound Mail Agent accessible via the defined hostname.

### 5.2 Install Inbound Mail Agent

Once the DNS record is created, proceed with the installation. The steps are similar to Step 4 for outbound agents, with one key difference. Instead of the regular outbound setup command, use the following to configure the inbound agent:

```bash
mail-agent setup --inbound --prod
```

This enables the agent to handle inbound emails.

### 5.3 Set Up Additional Inbound Mail Agents

If you need more inbound Mail Agents, repeat the DNS and installation steps. For example, for a second inbound Mail Agent in Bangalore, create the following DNS record:

```plaintext
i2-blr.frappemail.com
```

Follow the same process to install and configure the additional agents.
