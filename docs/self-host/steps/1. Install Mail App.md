## Step 1: Install Mail App

Start by installing the Mail app in a Frappe bench environment. You can do this in two ways: through the [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com/dashboard) for a simplified setup, or manually by following the steps below.

### Manual Installation Steps:

1. Navigate to your **Frappe Bench** directory.
2. Get the Mail app using the `bench` command:

   ```bash
   bench get-app mail
   ```

3. Install the Mail app on your desired site (e.g., `frappemail.com`)

   ```bash
   bench --site frappemail.com install-app mail
   ```

At this stage, leave the app unconfigured. Configuration will be done in the later steps. For now, just note down the **Host (Site URL)** and the **IP address** of the server where the Mail app is installed, as these will be required later for DNS and other setup tasks.
